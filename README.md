Weather Image Classification Using Deep Learning Models

Overview
--------

This project uses different deep learning models—DenseNet121, GoogLeNet, and EfficientNet—to classify weather conditions from images. The dataset includes various weather types such as rain, snow, and cloudy conditions. The goal was to compare the performance of these models and evaluate their accuracy in weather classification.

Models
------
- DenseNet121
- GoogLeNet
- EfficientNet

How to Run
----------
1. Clone the repository:

    git clone git@github.com:your_username/Weather-Classification.git
    cd Weather-Classification

2. Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to see the results for each model:

    - DenseNet121 Final.ipynb
    - GoogLeNet Final.ipynb
    - EfficientNet Final.ipynb

Results
-------
EfficientNet achieved the highest classification accuracy at 92.21%, followed by DenseNet121 and GoogLeNet. The models were evaluated using accuracy and F1-scores.
